/**
 * An icon made of simple shapes generated from a hash sequence.
 *
 * Identicons are generally used as placeholder images for user that don't have an avatar.
 * If the same sequence is used to create the icon, then the icon's look will be the same.
 *
 * There are 3 components used to generate an Identicon:
 *
 * - [Renderer] indicates where and how the icon should be drawn.
 * - [IconGenerator] describes the generation algorithm and the available shapes.
 * One could extend this class to define their own shapes and their position in the icon's grid.
 * - [IdenticonStyle] defines parameters that alters the icon's general look such as color and padding.
 *
 * Most common cases such as saving as SVG are covered by [saveAsSvg].
 * If you'd like to use your own implementation of [Renderer], you should pass it to the [draw] method.
 *
 * @constructor Creates a new icon of a given size with the given hash sequence, initialized with
 * default generator and style.
 *
 * While the hash sequence could be anything (calculated from a string, generated by a calculation,
 * queried from storage or network), make sure not to use sensitive information such as password
 * or auth token.
 *
 * @param hash The byte sequence to use as base to generate this icon.
 * There should be at least 6 bytes.
 * @param size The size of this icon in pixels.
